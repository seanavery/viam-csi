### why?

Want to use CSI cameras with viam? This is the module for you.

Most embedded cameras do not have an onboard [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processor) (image signal processor) and instead rely on the host machine for things like debayering, gamma-curve adjustments, gain control, white balance, and color correction.

ISPs are hard, so why roll your own? There are great libraries out there like [libargus](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/l4t-multimedia/group__LibargusAPI.html) and [libcamera](https://github.com/kbingham/libcamera).

viam-csi is a [Viam Module](https://docs.viam.com/extend/modular-resources/) that includes a simple wrapper around [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/?gi-language=c) and an interface that satisfies a [Viam Camera Component](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/webcam/). This means you can utilize the hardware accelerated GST plugins on your Jetson or Pi with the Viam ecosystem.

### usage

1. Download appimage from releases page.
```bash
sudo wget https://github.com/seanavery/viam-csi/releases/download/v0.0.2/viam-csi-0.0.2-aarch64.AppImage -O /usr/local/bin/viam-csi
```

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/viam-csi
```

2. Run [viam-server](https://docs.viam.com/installation/) with example config file [etc/app-config.json](https://github.com/seanavery/viam-csi/blob/master/etc/app-config.json).

viam-server will automatically load the module. You can now head over to app.viam.com and view the control tab for the camera feed. If you do not see anything, check the logs tab for errors.
